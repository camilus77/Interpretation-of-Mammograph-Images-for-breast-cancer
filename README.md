# Interpretation-of-Mammograph-Images-for-breast-cancer
The interpretation of mammograms for breast cancer is crucial for early detection and successful treatment. 
However, accurately identifying and analyzing abnormal growths or tumors in breast tissue from mammographic images can be challenging. 
Currently, there is a need to develop effective algorithms or technologies that can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of mammogram interpretation, 
enabling healthcare professionals to detect breast cancer at its earliest stages.  
It has been said that 5% to 10% of mammograms are referred for further investigation by way of biopsy due to inconclusive or abnormal results. 
It is this 5 - 10% of cases that this project will aim at adderessing.
In this project, deep learning techniques is used to classify breast cancer from mammograph images.
